* On a Raspberry Pi or other Linux device ... https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi 
* In the Cloud ... https://fred.sensetecnic.com/

The simplest route is often to setup a free cloud service at https://fred.sensetecnic.com/ where you can run an instance of Node-RED for 24 hours before it needs restarting. The most powerful route is to permanently setup a Raspberry Pi on your local network, running Node-RED continuously.
