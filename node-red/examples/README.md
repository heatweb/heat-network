# Node-RED Example Flows
The flows here can be pasted directly into Node-RED and deployed for test purposes.  

## flow_parse_mqtt.json
This is an example of how to pull the descriptions and additional information for standard MQTT topics from the GitHub repository. The flow generates dummy MQTT data for demonstration purposes, and uses a public MQTT server.
